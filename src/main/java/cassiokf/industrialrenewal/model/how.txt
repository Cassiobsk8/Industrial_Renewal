Cassi: it was replaced with model data
you can override getModelData in either your IBakedModel, or your TileEntity
and receive it in getQuads(..., IModelData)
the getModelData methods are called on the world thread, not the render thread
and you can request an update from the TE by using this.requestModelDataRefresh()
when the TE contents change
